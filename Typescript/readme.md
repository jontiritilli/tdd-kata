# Javascript TDD Katas with Typescript
## Instructions
 Before you start, create a new branch off master for your work
- Install dependencies by running `yarn install` or `npm install`

## Usage
If you don't know where to start, or what the hell this is, start [here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/content/course/test-driven-development). It's a great free course from IBM. A bit cheesy, but full of good info

### Commands 
Run the tests with `yarn test` or `npm run test` *but you know which you should use...*

Watch with `yarn watch` or `npm run watch`

## Final Words
If you get stuck, I'm working on adding a `completed` branch in this repository, which will have the completed katas, but if you look at them you're a cheater and everyone will know, and they aren't there yet. So good luck.
