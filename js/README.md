## Usage

- Before you start, create a new branch off master for your work.
- Install dependencies by running `yarn install` or `npm install`
- To run the tests, run `yarn test` or `npm run test`
- While you're writing tests, run `yarn watch` or `npm run watch` so your tests run while your write code.
- If you get stuck, the branch `completed` in this repository has the completed katas, but if you look at them you're a cheater and everyone will know.
